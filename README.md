BEARscc - Bayesian ERCC Assessment of Robustness  
================================================

# Summary
Single-cell transcriptome sequencing data are subject to substantial technical variation and batch effects that can confound the classification of cellular sub-types. Unfortunately, current clustering algorithms don't account for this uncertainty. To address this shortcoming, we have developed a noise perturbation algorithm called **BEARscc** that is designed to determine the extent to which classifications by existing clustering algorithms are robust to observed technical variation.

**BEARscc** makes use of ERCC spike-in measurements to model technical variance as a function of gene expression and technical dropout effects on lowly expressed genes. In our benchmarks, we found that BEARscc accurately models read count fluctuations and drop-out effects across transcripts with diverse expression levels. Applying our approach to publicly available single-cell transcriptome data of mouse brain and intestine, we have demonstrated that BEARscc identified cells that cluster consistently, irrespective of technical variation:

# Installation

Installing BEARscc is easy. You can download a binary package [here](https://bitbucket.org/ludwigbioinf/bearscc/raw/ebfe054be6bac0082adc97ee6774a0b69b32c9c4/builds/BEARscc_0.1.0.tgz). You can then use `install.packages` as normal, but give it the location of the downloaded file:

```R
 install.packages('BEARscc_0.1.0.tgz')
 ```
 

# Usage

Here we provide a limited illustrative example of BEARscc on example data. A comprehensive vignette is being drafted and will be available in the near future. 

In R, load a single cell data table and ERCC known concentrations:

`data.counts.dt<- fread("example/brain_control_example.tsv")`
`ERCC.meta.dt<- fread("example/ERCC.meta.tsv")`

Seperate ERCC observations into a `data.frame` and transfrom counts and ERCC known concentration `data.table` into `data.frame`.

`ERCC.counts.df<-data.frame(data.counts.dt[GENE_ID%like%"ERCC-",], row.names="GENE_ID")` 
`data.counts.df<-data.frame(data.dt, row.names = "GENE_ID")` 
`ÃˆRCC.meta.df<-data.frame(ERCC.meta.dt, row.names="ERCC_ID")` 

Estimate noise inputting ERCC known concentrations, and both endogenous and spike-in counts matrices into `estimate_noiseparameters()` function.

`results<-estimate_noiseparameters(ERCC.counts.df,ERCC.meta.df, data.counts.df,granularity=30, write.noise.model=TRUE, file="noise_estimation", model_view=c("Observed","Optimized"))`

Several options exist:

`granularity` determines the number of bins for comparison of the quality of fit between the mixed-model and observed data for each alpha. This should be set lower for small datasets and higher for datasets with more observations

`write.noise.model=TRUE` outputs two tab-delimited files containing the dropout effects and noise model parameters; this allows users to apply the noise generation on a seperate high compute node. 

`plot==TRUE` will plot all linear fits and individual ERCCs distributions across samples, where `model_view=c("Observed", "Optimized", "Poisson", "Neg. Binomial"` determines the statistical distributions that should be plotted for the ERCC plots. `file="./Rplot"` determines the root name for all plots, which write to the current working directory unless a path is contained in the root name. 


Following estimation of noise the parameters are used to generate a noise-injected counts matrix. 

`noisy_counts.list<-create_noiseinjected_counts(results, n=10)`

`results` is the list object generated by the function `estimate_noiseparameters()` and the variable `n` is the desired number of clusters. For larger datasets it is recommended that the user set `write.noise.model=TRUE` and copy the written bayesian drop-out and noise estimate files with the observed counts table to a high powered computing environment. The script `HPC_generate_noise_matrices` contains `create_noiseinjected_counts()` functions that are adapted to a parallel environment along with suggested code, which is commented out for user-modification. The script generates seperate noise-injected counts files, which can be loaded into R as a list or re-clustered seperately in a high powered compute environment. The resulting object is a list, where each element is a noise-injected counts matrix, and one element is the original counts matrix. 

After generating noise-injected counts tables, these should be re-clustered using the clustering method applied to the original dataset. For simplicity, here we use hierarchical clustering on a euclidean distance metric to identify two clusters. In our experience, some published clustering algorithms are sensitive to cell order, so we suggest scrambling the order of cells for each noise iteration we do below.  

To quickly recluster a list, we define a reclustering function:

```recluster<-function(x){
  x<-data.frame(x, row.names = "GENE_ID")
  scramble<-sample(colnames(x), size=length(colnames(x)), replace=FALSE)
  x<-x[,scramble]
  clust<-hclust(dist(t(x),method="euclidean"),method="complete")
  clust<-cutree(clust,2)
  data.frame(clust)
}``` 

We then recluster and manipulate the list into a `data.frame`. 

```clusters.list<-lapply(noisy_counts.list, `recluster`)
clusters.df<-do.call("cbind", cluster.list)
colnames(clusters.df)<-names(cluster.list)```

If running clustering algorithms on a seperate high power cluster, then retrieve labels and format as a data.frame of cluster labels, where the last column must be the original cluster labels derived from the observed count data. As an example, examine the file, `example/example_clusters.tsv`.

With a cluster labels file as described above, we can generate a noise consensus matrix using: 

`noise_consensus<-compute_consensus(clusters.df)`

For illustrative purpose, an image of the noise consensus matrix result of 30 iterations of BEARscc has been included, `example/example_30iterations_consensus_matrix_heatmap.png`.

In order to help interpret the noise consensus we have defined three cluster (and analagous cell) metrics. Stabilty indicates the propensity for a putative cluster to remain constant across noise-injected counts matrices. Promiscuity indicates a tendency for a putative cluster to associate with other clusters across noise-injected counts matrices. Score represents the promiscuity substracted from the stability. We have found it useful to identify the optimal number of clusters in terms of resiliance to noise by examining these metrics for the original clustering and by cutting hierarchical tress of the noise consensus. To do this create a vector of the number of cluster one wishes to examine (the funciton automatically determines the results for one cluster) and cluster the consensus:

`vector<-seq(from=2, to=5, by=1)` 
`BEARscc_clusts.df<-cluster_consensus(noise_consensus,vector)` 

And add the original clustering to the `data.frame`: `BEARscc_clusts.df<-cbind(BEARscc_clusts.df, Original=clusters.df$Original_counts)` 

Compute cluster metrics by running the command: `cluster_scores.dt<-report_cluster_metrics(BEARscc_clusts.df,noise_consensus, plot=TRUE, file="example")`

The output is a melted `data.table` that displays the name of each cluster, the size of each cluster, the metric (score, Promiscuity, Stability), the value for each metric, the clustering in question (1,2,...,Original), whether the cluster consists of only one cell, and finally the mean of the metric across all clusters in the clustering.  

An example of the resulting plot for 3 noise-injected perturbations is provided for the user's reference: `example/example_cluster_scores.pdf`. It is evident from the plot that one cluster is optimal and outperform the original clustering which bifurcated this set of purely technical data.

Likewise, the cell metrics may be computed using:
`cell_scores.dt<-report_cell_metrics(BEARscc_clusts.df, noise_consensus)`

The output is a melted `data.table` that displays the name of each cluster to which the cell belongs, the cell label, the size of each cluster, the metric (score, Promiscuity, Stability), the value for each metric, and finally the clustering in question (1,2,...,Original).

These results can be plotted to visualize cells in the context of different clusterings using `ggplot2`.
